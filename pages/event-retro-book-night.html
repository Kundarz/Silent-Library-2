      Step back in time with Silent Library’s <strong>Retro Book Night</strong>, a nostalgic celebration of literature’s golden eras.
      Dust off your vintage reading glasses and immerse yourself in classic novels, pulp fiction, and timeless stories that shaped generations.
      This evening is dedicated to reviving the charm and atmosphere of mid-20th century reading culture, complete with themed décor, music, and refreshments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you grew up flipping through dog-eared paperbacks or are discovering these treasures for the first time, Retro Book Night
      promises a rich, sensory journey. Expect comfy armchairs, warm lamplight, and the soft crackle of vinyl records playing jazz, blues,
      and old-school rock in the background — setting the perfect mood for getting lost in a book.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the night, attendees can browse curated collections featuring authors like Ray Bradbury, Agatha Christie, Langston Hughes,
      and Sylvia Plath. Special focus will be given to iconic works that defined genres such as noir, beat poetry, and post-war realism.
      You’ll find display cases highlighting rare first editions, vintage covers, and author memorabilia.
    </p>

    <p>
      The event also features live readings by local actors and poets, who will bring to life excerpts from beloved retro classics.
      For those who like to participate, there will be “Lit Bingo” games with questions and clues inspired by literary history and popular culture
      of the 1950s-70s. Prizes include signed books, retro-style bookmarks, and exclusive library swag.
    </p>

    <p>
      Retro-themed refreshments like classic soda floats, coffee served in vintage mugs, and homemade cookies will be available.
      The Silent Library team encourages guests to dress in period-inspired outfits — think leather jackets, berets, and cat-eye glasses —
      to fully embrace the spirit of the night.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond just reading, Retro Book Night is about community and storytelling traditions passed down through generations.
      It’s a chance to share memories, discover new favorites, and reflect on how literature continues to evolve while honoring its roots.
      Come prepared for a cozy, immersive experience that reconnects you with the magic of printed pages and bygone eras.

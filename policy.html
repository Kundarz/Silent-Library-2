    <h2><i class="calendar-icon">ðŸ“œ</i> Silent Library Policy & Usage Guidelines</h2>

    <p><strong>1. Code of Conduct</strong><br>
    Silent Library operates as a sanctuary for readers, researchers, and digital explorers. To maintain the contemplative atmosphere our patrons expect, absolute silence is enforced in all designated zones. Conversations, phone calls, or any audible disturbances must be taken to sound-permissible areas outside the main reading halls. Staff may intervene when necessary to maintain quietude. Repeated offenses may result in temporary removal from the premises.</p>

    <p>All visitors are expected to show mutual respect to fellow patrons, staff, and library property. Discrimination, harassment, or aggressive behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. The library is a shared space dedicated to learning, reflection, and digital literacy. Disregard for these values will be treated as a serious violation of community guidelines.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Membership & Access Control</strong><br>
    Access to library facilities and resources is available to all registered members. Memberships are issued upon completion of a digital registration form and a brief orientation on responsible usage. Each member is issued a unique ID and access QR code. Sharing or misuse of access credentials is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <p>Membership tiers include General, Student, Researcher, and Partner categories. Each tier has specific borrowing limits, access duration, and digital license rights. Members are responsible for keeping their account information confidential and must report any suspected compromise immediately to the administration desk.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Borrowing, Renewals & Returns</strong><br>
    Patrons may borrow up to 5 physical items at a time, with a standard loan duration of 14 calendar days. One renewal (7 days) is allowed per item unless the item is on hold for another user. Renewals can be processed via the library app, at a kiosk, or through staff assistance.</p>

    <p>Late returns are subject to a fine of $0.50 per day per item. Patrons with overdue balances exceeding $10.00 will have their borrowing privileges temporarily suspended. Materials returned damaged or defaced will incur a replacement fee equivalent to the current market value plus a $5.00 processing charge. Patrons are encouraged to handle all materials with care and avoid exposure to food, drink, or high humidity environments.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Digital Content & Licensing Restrictions</strong><br>
    Silent Library offers access to a diverse range of digital media, including eBooks, audiobooks, academic databases, and archived content. All digital resources are protected under international copyright law and specific vendor licensing agreements. Usage is restricted to personal, non-commercial purposes unless otherwise noted.</p>

    <p>Downloading, screen-recording, extracting DRM-locked material, or sharing access with non-members is considered a breach of contract and may result in immediate termination of account privileges. Patrons are encouraged to review licensing terms displayed at the start of each digital session. Any questions about permissible use should be directed to the Digital Access Coordinator.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Technology Access, Wi-Fi & Public Terminals</strong><br>
    Complimentary Wi-Fi is available to all registered users. Access is filtered in compliance with Singaporeâ€™s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) standards. Public terminals are equipped with secure, privacy-focused browsers and productivity tools for study and research. Sessions are limited to 60 minutes during peak hours.</p>

    <p>Installation of unauthorized software, attempts to access restricted files, or tampering with device settings is prohibited. Any suspicious digital behavior will be logged and investigated. Users are reminded that activity may be monitored in accordance with local laws and the Computer Misuse Act.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Surveillance, Security & Data Policy</strong><br>
    To ensure the safety of our visitors and the integrity of our resources, the facility is monitored by 24-hour surveillance. All footage is stored securely and may be used in the event of an incident investigation. By entering the premises, visitors consent to being recorded in public-access areas.</p>

    <p>The Silent Library adheres to strict data privacy regulations in compliance with Singaporeâ€™s PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act). Personal data collected during membership registration is encrypted and used solely for account verification, notification services, and internal research analytics. Data is never sold or shared with third parties without user consent. For a full breakdown, refer to our <a href="#">Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Room Reservations & Event Participation</strong><br>
    The library features multiple discussion rooms, soundproof study pods, and digital collaboration spaces. Reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance via our web portal. A maximum of 2 hours per session is allowed, with extension permitted if space is available. Priority is given to academic and community-driven projects.</p>

    <p>Library-hosted events, workshops, and forums are open to all members. However, pre-registration is required due to limited seating. Event attendees must follow all in-house conduct policies. No-shows may affect eligibility for future sessions.</p>

    <p><strong>8. Food, Beverage & Clean Zone Protocol</strong><br>
    To maintain the pristine condition of our physical resources, food consumption is strictly prohibited within reading zones. Only water in sealable bottles is allowed. Visitors found eating or bringing in restricted items may be asked to leave the area.</p>

    <p>Clean zones, marked with special signage, include archival rooms and digital scanning areas. Patrons must sanitize hands before handling fragile documents or using touchscreen terminals. Disposable gloves are available at the archive desk upon request.</p>

    <p><strong>9. Accessibility & Inclusion</strong><br>
    Silent Library is committed to providing an inclusive, barrier-free environment. All areas are wheelchair accessible, and assistive reading devices, screen readers, and large-print resources are available upon request. Our staff is trained in accessibility support and will assist any patron needing special accommodations.</p>

    <p>Feedback from members of the community, especially those with disabilities or unique learning needs, is welcomed. You may submit suggestions anonymously through our <a href="#">Accessibility Portal</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>10. Children & Guardian Policy</strong><br>
    Children under the age of 12 must be accompanied by a parent or authorized guardian at all times. The library is not a childcare facility, and staff cannot assume responsibility for unattended minors. Designated family zones are available for supervised study or reading.</p>

    <p>Parents are encouraged to monitor their childâ€™s digital use, particularly in relation to online materials. Child-safe filters are in place, but guardians remain responsible for appropriate content selection.</p>

    <p><strong>11. Emergencies, Health & Safety</strong><br>
    In case of fire, power outage, or civil emergency, patrons must follow evacuation instructions issued via the public address system. Emergency exits are clearly marked throughout the facility. Staff will guide patrons to the nearest safe zone or assembly area.</p>

    <p>First aid kits and AED units are available at all service desks. In the event of injury, staff trained in CPR and first aid will provide immediate support while awaiting medical services. All incidents must be reported immediately to the nearest personnel.</p>

    <p><strong>12. Enforcement & Appeals</strong><br>
    Violations of library policies may result in verbal warnings, written citations, temporary bans, or permanent expulsion from all facilities and services. Infractions are recorded in the patronâ€™s account history. Serious offenses may be escalated to legal authorities.</p>

    <p>Appeals must be submitted in writing within 7 calendar days of any disciplinary action. A review panel will assess the case and issue a final decision within 5 business days. All appeal decisions are final.</p>

    <p><em>Silent Library reserves the right to amend policies as required by institutional, legal, or technological developments. Members will be notified via email and public bulletin.</em></p>
